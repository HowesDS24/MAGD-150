# MAGD 150 Assignments
## Assignment 3  
Assignment 3 was the first that dealt with coding that was not just used for drawing shapes.  
This places elippses which have positions determined by the mouse location, and sizes  
determined by mouse speed.
## Assignment 5
Assignment 5 was the first time we learned how to creae working buttons. One of the optional  
prompts was to create a TV set, so I went with that one. If you press "X" on the larger  
ellipse at the bottom, the screen turns white, and if you click the rectangle to thr right of  
it, it turns off. The buttons were created by telling the browser that if a certain action is  
taken, like a specific key press or mouse click happens inside a certain perimiter, it will  
do whatever you tell it to. 
## Assignment 8 
Assignment 8 was our first experience with importing external things, such as pictures.  
It was slightly more complicated than I expected, because the web browser does not allow  
you to import these things for security reasons, so we had to use an app that created  
a server where we could run the code. This made the whole learning process a bit more  
difficult, because we were kind of programming "blind" in a way. We also learned how to  
use text in p5.
